## Introduction

The Met Office, as the national meteorological service for the United Kingdom, provides valuable weather data through its API called DataPoint. This API caters to a wide range of users, including professionals, scientists, students, and amateur developers. One of its notable features is the availability of text-based regional weather forecasts.

Traditional text-to-image systems often struggle with accurately representing descriptive language, leading users to navigate the complexities of prompt engineering to achieve their desired visual output. However, the landscape is rapidly changing with the use of AI. OpenAI’s latest release, DALL·E 3, simplifies this process by generating images that align with the provided text.

Ihe python script combines Met Office weather forecasts with DALL·E 3 via its API. Our goal is to create captivating landscape imagery that reflects the weather conditions described in the forecast. These images are then uploaded to our webserver, using FTP for viewing online. If you simply want to create an image, then you can leave the FTP section out.

## The Workflow

### Met Office Data Retrieval

We fetch the weather forecast data from the Met Office DataPoint API. Specifically, we focus on today’s weather conditions. We are using the UK Met Office, but it could be any weather API, from any country, that returns forecast text.

### Creating the Image Prompt

We construct an image prompt that encapsulates the essence of the weather. Our prompt includes the landscape type (e.g., "rural Norfolk landscape") and the specific weather details obtained from the Met Office. The landscape type can be edited accordingly.

### DALL·E 3 Image Generation

Leveraging OpenAI’s DALL·E 3 model, we generate an image based on the provided prompt. The image should realistically depict cloud formations, sunlight, precipitation, and wind effects, all while capturing the mood suggested by the weather.

### FTP Upload

Finally, we upload the generated image to an FTP server for public access. We run the script every 12 hours (ours runs on a Raspberry Pi) with the images archived on the webserver. Below is a gallery showing some of the images from the last few months:



This integration of AI technologies with environmental data opens new avenues for creative and practical applications. Whether for educational purposes, professional settings, or personal projects, the potential to visualize weather forecasts vividly brings a new dimension to data interpretation and usage.
